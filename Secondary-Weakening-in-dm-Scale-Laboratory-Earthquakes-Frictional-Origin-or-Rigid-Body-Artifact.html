        <h2>Abstract</h2>

        <p>
            Earthquakes arise from rapid slip along faults, and such dynamic processes are well described by linear
            elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). In recent years, this framework has been extended to laboratory
            earthquakes in an effort to bridge laboratory and natural observations. However, laboratory and natural
            earthquakes differ by orders of magnitude in spatial scale and event size, and differences in boundary
            conditions further challenge the direct applicability of laboratory results to natural systems.
        </p>

        <p>
            To investigate earthquake energy budgets under controlled conditions, we have developed a dm-scale
            single-direct-shear polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) fault system consisting of a stationary and a moving
            block, subjected to independently controlled normal and shear loading. Normal stresses of 12-32 MPa are
            applied over a 50 cm × 5 cm fault area, while a constant shear loading rate is imposed on the moving block
            at the load point, promoting spontaneous rupture nucleation. A dense strain gauge array instrumented within
            10 mm of the fault enables direct measurement of dynamic strain during rupture nucleation, propagation, and
            arrest, as well as estimation of on-fault weakening behavior. Preliminary results reveal a secondary
            weakening stage following the initial friction drop, with significantly larger amplitude that substantially
            increases apparent breakdown work and modifies source-time functions and far-field seismic radiation.
        </p>

        <p>
            To interpret experimental observations, we perform finite-element simulations that explicitly incorporate
            the experimental geometry, elastic properties, and boundary conditions. Comparisons between numerical and
            measured strain fields allow us to examine rupture dynamics, energy localization, and the partitioning
            between fault dissipation and rigid-body-motion-induced apparatus unloading, and to assess the extent to
            which laboratory earthquakes satisfy LEFM assumptions, identifying deviations arising from finite-size
            effects.
        </p>

        <p>
            While secondary weakening may be attributed to complex frictional constitutive behavior, our results
            highlight that energy release associated with rigid-body motion of the experimental blocks and apparatus
            unloading-a mechanism with no obvious direct analogue in natural earthquakes-plays a key role. As a
            consequence, energy release in laboratory earthquakes is often spatially non-localized, in contrast to the
            highly localized rupture processes assumed in LEFM descriptions of natural events.
