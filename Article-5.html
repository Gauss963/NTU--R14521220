        <h2>January</h2>
        <p>
            2025 started with a pleasant gathering with all my best friends from B09s. 
            We finally get to have a graduation photo together. later on I started my first
            project in Ke's lab. I was so excited to work on something new and challenging, but again,
            I felt a bit overwhelmed by how unpredictable an AI model can be. Later this month, I went to Kaohsiung
            to meet with Isabelle. Initially I planned to just have a short gathering, but it happened
            to have a free concert by "Mayday" that night, so we stayed and enjoyed the music.

        <h2>February</h2>
        <p>
            February was a short month. Started with the deadline for the JPGU meeting abstract submission, I had two abstracts,
            one for the QSIS project and another for the AI-based stress-drop estimation. I also went camping with my labmates,
            so glad that I got to know them better outside of the lab, they are all great people.

        </p>

        <h2>March</h2>
        <p>
            This month my final semester as an undergraduate student began. I enrolled in several interesting courses, including
            "Principle of Seismology". Then I went to NCHC's headquarter for a seminar about deep learning implementation on HPC
            systems. It was a great opportunity to learn about the latest advancements in AI and HPC technologies, but went to 
            Zhubei during rush hour was a nightmare. Later this month, one of my favorite movies "Love Letter" was re-released in theaters.

                Figure 3. One of my favorite movie "Love Letter" was replyed this month.
                I went to watch it again in the theater, and I had the first week poster of my favorite character, Fujii Shu.

        </p>

        <h2>April</h2>
        <p>
            There was a huge earthquake in April. I was excited to see the waveform data, but due to a power issue, there was
            nothing recorded. Overall, the weather in April was comfortable, except for a few massive rainstorms.

                We can now start doing some experiments. The are the first lab. in Taiwan
                that can do this kind of experiments.

        <h2>May</h2>
        <p>
            My birthday was on May 2nd. I invited my best friends for pizza, and I was really happy everyone came. The CE
            department's graduation ceremony was also in May. I went with my dog so he could meet my friends, but it made me feel a
            bit lonely knowing I couldn't graduate just yet.

        </p>

        <h2>June</h2>
        <p>
            June was rather boring. I struggled with group theory and spent most of my time in the library. Something big happened
            this month, but I don't think I seized the opportunity.

        </p>

        <h2>July</h2>
        <p>
            July was a happy month. I saw old friends and met new ones. It began with a rocket launch live-stream, a visit to Ken’s
            lab, and I also got to drive another Mercedes E from the car maintenance shop.

        </p>

        <h2>August</h2>
        <p>
            I visited Hualien for the first time in my life, traveling with six summer intern students. I saw the famous DAS system
            and cleared some doubts about the fiber coupling issue, which is still something they need to solve. I installed one
            QSIS at my house and another in Hualien. The 113-1 semester schedule also came out this month. I enrolled in
            “Introduction to Field Geology (Ⅱ),” which would become quite demanding later on.

        </p>

        <h2>September</h2>
        <p>
            I attended a very interesting seminar this month, featuring several insightful but also some questionable topics. The
            big news: I met my prospective master's advisor. It all began with small talk about the CE department and ultimately
            planted the seed for a future collaboration.

        </p>

        <h2>October</h2>
        <p>
            Starting in October, my ear felt a bit strange. I went to the hospital and found out it was infected by mold, so I
            couldn't use an earpiece for at least a month. That was unfortunate. Afterward, I visited Tainan for the first time ever
            (I'm clearly not a very well-traveled Taiwanese).

        </p>

        <h2>November</h2>
        <p>
            I was super excited about November. I took graduation photos for both of my departments, had dinner with Dr. Ma,
            pestered her student with my Geoscience questions, and then took a bus south for some fun in Hengchun — my first time
            there. I ran into a small dilemma: I wanted a photo with a friend but also wanted her to invite me first. In the end, I
            got no photos with her or of her. Looking back, I should've just asked.

        </p>

        <h2>December</h2>
        <p>
            December was uneventful. I prepared a charity Christmas gift for the fifth consecutive year. This time, I gave an
            eight-year-old girl the “toy car” she wanted. I can't remember the last time I received a Christmas gift — perhaps in
            high school?
