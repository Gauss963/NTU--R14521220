        <p>
            November began with an endless Ising Model simulation.
            Then everyone started arguing about that overpass. I don't know how others feel about it, but I really hate that
            overpass. I dislike how it clamps down on the skyline of Xinsheng South Rd. and cuts off Heping East Rd.
            In the following muddled days, I discovered that several of my Medium articles have been indexed by Google, which has
            greatly helped my views and readership. However, my next article has been stalled for quite a while; I hope to finish it
            before the end of the year.
            Before I knew it, it was already mid-month, and there was only a week left before going to Hengchun. Actually, I've long
            known that I know nothing about rocks — to the extent that I might get scammed when decorating a house in the future.
            After taking group photos for both departments, enjoying a free meal with Dr. Ma, and mixing a few beaker of chemicals,
            I boarded a bus to the south for some fun (at least I thought it would be fun).
            Hengchun was great. Before taking the course, I asked two friends who had taken the geological survey whether I should
            pay for it. The first person said, “Based on what I know about you, you'll be miserable.” The second person said, “That
            course is super fun; you'll definitely enjoy it.” Who was right? On the bus during return trip, I wrote down my thoughts
            like this:
        </p>


        <div>
            <blockquote>
                "Overall, taking ‘Introduction to Field Geology (Ⅱ)’ this time was like taking a big bite of a watermelon. Before biting,
                I was excited; as I bit into it, the sweetness filled my mouth — extremely delightful — and then I bit into a seed. A
                burst of bitterness exploded in my mouth… And the second and third bites were the same. Can’t say it wasn’t tasty, but
                it would have been better if I could have removed those seeds."
            </blockquote>
        </div>

        </p>

            After some time, when I’m no longer angry about the hole photographing event, I should post my full reflections on the
            course on Medium. At least before next semester starts? Might as well grab some traffic first.
