        <h2>Abstract</h2>

        <p>
            Stress drop is a key parameter that influences earthquake rupture processes and ground-motion
            characteristics.
            By quantifying the difference in shear stress before and after a rupture, it offers direct insight into how
            energy
            is released during an earthquake. However, stress drop varies significantly from fault to fault and from
            event
            to event, underscoring the importance of improved measurement techniques. Previous studies have successfully
            adopted machine learning in laboratory earthquake datasets to predict time to failure (Rouet-Leduc 2017) and
            shear stress (Shreedharan 2021). However, their experimental fault systems were predominantly unstable.
            Specifically, the system is unstable when the loading stiffness k’ is much lower than the critical stiffness
            k<sub>c</sub>’,
            i.e., k’ ≪ k<sub>c</sub>’. Single state variable rate-and-state friction model suggests that slow-slip
            behavior
            emerges in the special case where k’ ≈ k<sub>c</sub>’, which has significance for slow earthquake detection
            and
            earthquake early-warning systems.
        </p>

        <p>
            In this study, we conducted double direct shear experiments on granite faults and generated laboratory
            earthquakes across a range of critical stiffness ratios (K = k’/k<sub>c</sub>’), from near-critical
            conditions
            (K ≈ 1) to highly unstable (K ≪ 1). These conditions were achieved by varying normal stress, shearing rate,
            and loading stiffness. Acoustic emission (AE) data were collected continuously at 2.5 MHz using an array of
            12 ultrasonic piezoelectric transducers embedded in a steel block, which is in direct contact with one of
            the granite side block. Additionally, shear strain was recorded at 13 equidistant locations at 100 kHz to
            capture transient local strain perturbations along the 15-cm saw-cut granite fault.
            At near-critical conditions, we observed consecutive events with highly variable stress-drops.
            The datasets with diverse event characteristics better emulate natural faults without strictly repeating
            rupture
            patterns and offer a broader training set for machine learning models, enhancing robustness in stress drop
            estimation and potentially improving their ability to generalize across varying fault conditions.
        </p>

        <p>
            For large earthquakes, well-established techniques—such as finite-fault inversions, back-projection, and
            other
            seismological models—can be used to estimate stress drop. However, for small earthquakes (magnitude M ≤ 2),
            these methods often become infeasible due to sparse data and low signal-to-noise ratios. To date, accurately
            measuring the in situ stress drop at small fault ruptures remains a challenge, and thus these techniques are
            typically evaluated through numerical simulations or laboratory analogs.
        </p>

        <p>
            Leveraging the power of Transformer-based machine learning, multiple acoustic emissions signals from
            different
            channels are concatenated into multi-dimensional features and fed into a Transformer model. By treating all
            these signals as one “multi-feature” sequence (rather than separate inputs), the self-attention mechanism
            within
            the Transformer can learn the complex temporal correlations among them. The model can effectively capture
            how
            changes in one signal relate to another over time, enabling robust predictions of stress drop even with
            limited, noisy data.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our results suggest that combining data-driven machine learning models with direct shear experiments could
            bridge the gap between controlled laboratory measurements and real-world earthquake processes.
