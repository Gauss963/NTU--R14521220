        <h2>January</h2>
        <p>
            I didn't do much in January. I washed my car with Ray, who had just returned from mainland China, and I had a pleasant
            lunch with some professors.

        </p>


        <h2>February</h2>
        <p>
            The final semester began (for B09s), which meant it was my last chance to eat, study, and have fun with them. I took
            another Logic class with Ken — probably our last class together.

        </p>

        <h2>March</h2>
        <p>
            Starting in March, life became busier. I spent a lot of time in the lab, tuning the laser. I also went to the NTU Azalea 
            Festival and dressed as a high school student, although that didn't quite work out.

        </p>

        <h2>April</h2>
        <p>
            There was a huge earthquake in April. I was excited to see the waveform data, but due to a power issue, there was
            nothing recorded. Overall, the weather in April was comfortable, except for a few massive rainstorms.

        </p>

        <h2>May</h2>
        <p>
            My birthday was on May 2nd. I invited my best friends for pizza, and I was really happy everyone came. The CE
            department's graduation ceremony was also in May. I went with my dog so he could meet my friends, but it made me feel a
            bit lonely knowing I couldn't graduate just yet.

        </p>

        <h2>June</h2>
        <p>
            June was rather boring. I struggled with group theory and spent most of my time in the library. Something big happened
            this month, but I don't think I seized the opportunity.

        </p>

        <h2>July</h2>
        <p>
            July was a happy month. I saw old friends and met new ones. It began with a rocket launch live-stream, a visit to Ken’s
            lab, and I also got to drive another Mercedes E from the car maintenance shop.

        </p>

        <h2>August</h2>
        <p>
            I visited Hualien for the first time in my life, traveling with six summer intern students. I saw the famous DAS system
            and cleared some doubts about the fiber coupling issue, which is still something they need to solve. I installed one
            QSIS at my house and another in Hualien. The 113-1 semester schedule also came out this month. I enrolled in
            “Introduction to Field Geology (Ⅱ),” which would become quite demanding later on.

        </p>

        <h2>September</h2>
        <p>
            I attended a very interesting seminar this month, featuring several insightful but also some questionable topics. The
            big news: I met my prospective master's advisor. It all began with small talk about the CE department and ultimately
            planted the seed for a future collaboration.

        </p>

        <h2>October</h2>
        <p>
            Starting in October, my ear felt a bit strange. I went to the hospital and found out it was infected by mold, so I
            couldn't use an earpiece for at least a month. That was unfortunate. Afterward, I visited Tainan for the first time ever
            (I'm clearly not a very well-traveled Taiwanese).
        <figure>

        </figure>
        </p>

        <h2>November</h2>
        <p>
            I was super excited about November. I took graduation photos for both of my departments, had dinner with Dr. Ma,
            pestered her student with my Geoscience questions, and then took a bus south for some fun in Hengchun — my first time
            there. I ran into a small dilemma: I wanted a photo with a friend but also wanted her to invite me first. In the end, I
            got no photos with her or of her. Looking back, I should've just asked.

        </p>

        <h2>December</h2>
        <p>
            December was uneventful. I prepared a charity Christmas gift for the fifth consecutive year. This time, I gave an
            eight-year-old girl the “toy car” she wanted. I can't remember the last time I received a Christmas gift — perhaps in
            high school?
